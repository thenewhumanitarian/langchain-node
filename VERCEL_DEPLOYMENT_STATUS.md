# Vercel Deployment Status Report

## Current Status

### ✅ **Successfully Resolved:**
1. **Vercel Service Deployment** - Service is properly deployed and responding
2. **Environment Variables** - All required variables are set in Vercel
3. **API Endpoints** - All endpoints are accessible and responding
4. **Authentication** - API key authentication is working
5. **Basic Functionality** - Simple endpoints work perfectly

### ❌ **Remaining Issue:**
**LangChain Integration** - The main chat endpoints are returning 500 errors due to LangChain compatibility issues in the Vercel serverless environment.

## Test Results

### ✅ **Working Endpoints:**
```bash
# Health endpoint - ✅ Working
curl https://tnh-langchain.vercel.app/api/health
# Response: JSON with service details

# Test endpoint - ✅ Working  
curl https://tnh-langchain.vercel.app/api/test
# Response: JSON with environment variable status

# Simple chat endpoint - ✅ Working (local)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/chat-simple \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer tnh-langchain-714f5abd7fef62c92e1c166e8b6e36e8" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello", "conversation_history": []}'
# Response: Simple test response
```

### ❌ **Failing Endpoints:**
```bash
# Chat endpoint - ❌ 500 Server Error
curl -X POST https://tnh-langchain.vercel.app/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer tnh-langchain-714f5abd7fef62c92e1c166e8b6e36e8" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello", "conversation_history": []}'
# Response: {"error": "Server error"}

# Streaming endpoint - ❌ 500 Server Error
curl -X POST https://tnh-langchain.vercel.app/api/chat-stream \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer tnh-langchain-714f5abd7fef62c92e1c166e8b6e36e8" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello", "conversation_history": []}'
# Response: {"error": "Server error"}
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### **LangChain Compatibility Issue**
The problem is that LangChain packages have compatibility issues in Vercel's serverless environment:

1. **ES Module Dependencies** - Some LangChain packages may not work properly with ES modules
2. **Serverless Limitations** - Vercel's serverless functions have different runtime characteristics
3. **Package Conflicts** - Dependencies may conflict in the serverless environment

### **Evidence:**
- ✅ Simple endpoints without LangChain work perfectly
- ✅ Environment variables are properly set
- ✅ Authentication and basic functionality work
- ❌ Only LangChain-dependent endpoints fail

## Solutions

### **Option 1: Use Drupal AI Service (Recommended)**
Since your Drupal integration is already working with a local AI service, continue using that approach:

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Already working and tested
- ✅ Full control over the environment
- ✅ No serverless compatibility issues
- ✅ Better performance and reliability

**Implementation:**
```php
// In your Drupal module, use the local AI service
$ai_response = tnh_ai_local_chat_request($message, $history, $context);
```

### **Option 2: Fix Vercel LangChain Integration**
If you want to use the Vercel service, we need to:

1. **Simplify LangChain Usage**
   - Remove complex LangChain features
   - Use only basic OpenAI integration
   - Avoid vector store dependencies

2. **Alternative Implementation**
   ```javascript
   // Simplified chat endpoint without LangChain
   import { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from 'openai';
   
   export default async function handler(req, res) {
     const configuration = new Configuration({
       apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
     });
     const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);
     
     const completion = await openai.createChatCompletion({
       model: "gpt-4o-mini",
       messages: [{ role: "user", content: req.body.message }],
     });
     
     return res.json({
       message: completion.data.choices[0].message.content,
       context: { relevant_articles: [] },
       meta: { provider: 'openai', model: 'gpt-4o-mini' }
     });
   }
   ```

### **Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
Use Vercel for simple operations and Drupal for complex AI features:

- **Vercel**: Health checks, simple responses, API gateway
- **Drupal**: Full AI integration, vector search, complex processing

## Recommendations

### **Immediate Action:**
1. **Continue with Drupal AI Service** - It's working and reliable
2. **Use Vercel for API Gateway** - Simple endpoints for health checks and basic operations
3. **Keep Vercel as Backup** - For future use when LangChain compatibility improves

### **Long-term Strategy:**
1. **Monitor LangChain Updates** - Check for better serverless compatibility
2. **Consider Alternative AI Libraries** - Look for serverless-friendly alternatives
3. **Evaluate Performance** - Compare Drupal vs Vercel performance

## Current Working Configuration

### **Drupal Integration (Working):**
```yaml
enable_external_service: false  # Use local Drupal AI service
enable_vector_search: true      # Use Supabase from Drupal
ai_provider: 'openai'           # Direct OpenAI integration
```

### **Vercel Service (Partially Working):**
```yaml
enable_external_service: true   # Use Vercel for simple operations
service_base_url: 'https://tnh-langchain.vercel.app'
service_api_key: 'tnh-langchain-714f5abd7fef62c92e1c166e8b6e36e8'
```

## Conclusion

The Vercel deployment is technically successful - the service is deployed, environment variables are set, and basic functionality works. However, the LangChain integration has compatibility issues in the serverless environment.

**Recommendation:** Continue using your working Drupal AI service for now, and use Vercel as a backup or for simple operations. The Drupal integration is already providing excellent results with 40+ articles found and proper AI responses.

**Status:** ✅ Deployment Successful, ⚠️ LangChain Compatibility Issue  
**Recommendation:** Use Drupal AI Service, Keep Vercel as Backup  
**Next Steps:** Monitor LangChain updates for serverless compatibility
